## Goals

### Learn Closures ([source](https://code101.medium.com/understanding-closures-in-go-encapsulating-state-and-behaviour-558ac3617671#:~:text=Closures%20are%20a%20powerful%20feature,variables%20from%20their%20surrounding%20scope.))
Demonstrate the following:
- [ ] Encapsulating private state: Closures allow for the creation of functions with private variables that are inaccessible from outside the closure. This helps in building modular and secure code.
- [ ] Function factories: Closures can act as factories for generating specialized functions based on specific configurations or parameters. They allow for the creation of custom functions with pre-set behaviors.
- [ ] Maintaining state across multiple calls: Closures enable functions to retain state across successive invocations. The captured variables within closures store their values, allowing functions to remember and update their state as needed.
- [ ] Callbacks and event handlers: Closures are commonly used for implementing callbacks and event handlers. They capture variables and provide a mechanism for executing specific actions when events occur.
- [ ] Asynchronous operations: Closures are useful when dealing with asynchronous operations or goroutines. They help in passing data and behavior into goroutines, ensuring that each goroutine operates with its own set of captured variables.
